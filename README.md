### Lunch/Dinner
+ Burgers
  - Burgerjoint is hidden in the lobby of the Le Parker Meridian Hotel with no obivous signage. Certainly an experience, but perhaps has had it's heyday and is now overpriced and not worth it. I would recommend it for the novetly factor for a non-NYC-er. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d638999-Reviews-Burger_Joint_at_Le_Parker_Meridien_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html
  - Shakeshack started as an offshoot of Danny Meyer's Eleven Madison Park and originally served hotdogs from a cart.
The original location is in Madison Square Park (Madison Ave and 25th Str). On the griddle, they smash the burger down to get maximum browning and thus maximum tastes. For burgers, order the Shackstack, a cheese burger topped with a battered & fried and cheese filled mushroom. Shakeshack has two lines for customer ordering. If you don't want hot food, the use the little known `C-Line` for ordering shakes and custards. https://www.shakeshack.com/locations/
  - The Breslin offers a Lamb Burger with triple-fried fries. Nice outside-the-box burger and a place I'd like to visit again. http://citycookin.com/the-breslin-lamb-burger-with-feta/
