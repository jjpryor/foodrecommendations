### Lunch/Dinner
+ Burgers
  - Burgerjoint -  119 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019 - is hidden in the lobby of the Le Parker Meridian Hotel with no obivous signage. Certainly an experience, but perhaps has had it's heyday and is now overpriced and not worth it. I would recommend it for the novetly factor for a non-NYC-er. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d638999-Reviews-Burger_Joint_at_Le_Parker_Meridien_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html
  - Shakeshack - many locations (visit their website or consult google maps on cell phone).
    - They started as an offshoot of Danny Meyer's Eleven Madison Park and originally served hotdogs from a cart. The original location is in Madison Square Park (Madison Ave and 25th Str).
    - On the griddle, they smash the burger down to get maximum browning and thus maximum tastes. For burgers, order the Shackstack, a cheese burger topped with a battered & fried and cheese filled mushroom.
    - Shakeshack has two lines for customer ordering. If you don't want hot food, the use the little known `C-Line` for ordering shakes and custards. https://www.shakeshack.com/locations/
  - The Breslin - 16 W 29th St, New York, NY 10001 - (by April Bloomfield) offers a Lamb Burger with triple-fried fries. Nice outside-the-box burger and a sit-down waiter/waitress service place I'd like to visit again. Locally (upstate NY) sourced food and ever-evolving menu. http://ny.eater.com/2015/8/13/8422845/lamb-burger-nyc

+ BBQ
  - Hill Country Barbeque - 30 West 26th Street, New York, NY 10010 - is within walking distance of MSG/Penn Station, and is a slice of TX picked up and dropped right into midtown.
    - All meats are smoked in the central TX style. Nothing is slathered and dripping in sauce. Eating there is like eating at a butcher turned into a food court. You get a meal ticket and a tray and you order everything by the quarter pound, so if you want a lot, get a whole pound. If you just want to try it, get a quarter pound.
    - Things to order: Moist (more fatty) brisket. Or the lean brisket. 2 types of sausage links which are shipped uncooked from TX. Cucumber salad. Green been casserole. Pork ribs are not the trimmed and glazed St Louis ribs but are the full size spare ribs. 1st floor and downstairs seating with frequent live music.
  - Blue Smoke - 116 East 27th Street, New York, NY 10016 - A bit of a far walking distance from MSG / Penn Station (about 1 mile).
    - Blue Smoke is part of Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality group's umbrella of restaraunts. It is a restraurant first and a barbecue restraurant second. Its style is a normal sit-down restarurant with table-service down in an upscale look. Downstairs is also a live jazz club.
    - Pork ribs, brisket, mac & cheese, beans. All the food is great & good  ambiance. They have other entrees that are not just smoked meats. They have their own pastry chef. 
  - Daisy May's BBQ - 623 11th Ave, New York, NY 10036 - Cafeteria-style bbq joint that is west of Restaruant Row and closer to the west side piers. Pork ribs are good. The beef rib is usually great but sometimes they have an off-day and the beef rib is only just OK.
  - Tourist trap BBQ that I've had and will not have again
    - Virgil's - they were one of the first. I once had good smoked wings, and then 3 years later I had bad smoked wings and lackluster sandwich.
    - Hog Pit - not good bbq. Review say "cheap drinks" and "great mozzerella sticks" and less about bbq
    - Dallas BBQ
    - Brother Jimmy's BBQ
+ Korean
  - Hanjan - 36 West 26th Street, New York, NY - next to Hill Country Barbeque. It is small-plates tapas-style Korean comfort food. Kinda pricy. But I always wanted to go here. Lunch-time and dinner-time only. They close between lunch and dinner.
  - Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong - 1 E 32nd St, New York, NY 10016 - high quality but kinda pricey table-grilled Korean BBQ
  - Kyochon Manhattan - 319 5th Ave, New York, NY 10016 - pricey for the small portion but Korean Fried Chicken is light and crispy and is very different than traditional American battered fried chicken.
  - Hell's Chicken - 641 10th Ave, New York, NY 10036 - Hell's Kitchen area place for Korean Fried Chicken
